# MahmoudEzz-node-weather-app

This site is created by Mahmoud Ezz

It uses data from mapbox.net and weatherstack.com
I've used express for the server, Handlebars as a view engine and postman-request for handling requests.

I've deployed this simple project on Heroku which you can have a look on it by this link:
